# 📊 Consolidated Allure Reports System

## Problem Solved
Previously, Allure reports were automatically deleted by cleanup scripts, causing loss of historical test data. This system protects your valuable test reports using a single consolidated directory.

## Solution Overview

### 🏗️ Simplified Directory Structure
```
project/
├── allure-report/                      # 📊 CONSOLIDATED - All reports here
│   ├── run_20250913_170306/            # Historical report 1
│   ├── run_20250913_180415/            # Historical report 2
│   └── run_20250913_190522/            # Latest report
├── results/                            # 🗂️ Source data (temporary)
│   └── run_20250913_170306/
│       ├── allure-results/             # Raw test results
│       └── allure-report/              # Generated report (copied to main)
└── [cleanup scripts preserve allure-report/]
```

### 🛡️ Protection Mechanism
1. **Single Directory**: All reports consolidated in `allure-report/`
2. **Startup Protection**: `start.bat` preserves `allure-report/` directory
3. **Dashboard Integration**: Direct access to all historical reports
4. **Automatic Consolidation**: Every dashboard test run saves to main directory

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Dashboard
```bash
start.bat
# or
python dashboard.py
```

### 2. Run Tests 
Your dashboard automatically saves all reports to `allure-report/` directory.

### 3. View Reports
Click "📊 All Reports" in the sidebar to view all historical reports.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### Historical Reports Page
- Access via sidebar: **📊 All Reports**
- Shows all protected historical reports
- Sorted by date (newest first)
- Direct links to view each report

### URLs
- All reports: `http://localhost:5050/allure-report/run_TIMESTAMP`
- Historical overview: `http://localhost:5050/reports`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dashboard Changes
- **Consolidated Route**: `/allure-report/<run_id>` - Serves all reports
- **Single Directory Logic**: All reports in `allure-report/`
- **Simplified Management**: One location for all historical reports

### File Locations
- **All Reports**: `allure-report/run_TIMESTAMP/`
- **Source Data**: `results/run_TIMESTAMP/allure-report/` (temporary)

### Cleanup Safety
- **Main Directory**: `allure-report/` preserved by startup scripts
- **Results Directory**: Can be safely cleaned (temporary source data)

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
Clean temporary results when needed:
```bash
# Manually delete old results directories
rmdir /S /Q results\run_OLDTIMESTAMP
```

### Backup Important Reports
Backup the consolidated directory:
```bash
tar -czf allure-reports-backup.tar.gz allure-report/
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Main Directory**: Never manually delete `allure-report/`
2. **Startup Protection**: `start.bat` preserves `allure-report/` automatically
3. **Storage Space**: Monitor disk usage as historical reports accumulate
4. **Backup Strategy**: Consider regular backups of `allure-report/`

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Reports Still Disappearing
- Check if `start.bat` is being used (preserves `allure-report/`)
- Verify reports exist in `allure-report/` directory
- Ensure cleanup scripts don't target `allure-report/`

### Dashboard Not Showing Reports
- Check `allure-report/` directory exists
- Verify report folders have `index.html` files
- Check browser console for errors

### Disk Space Issues
- Manually delete old reports: `rmdir /S /Q allure-report\run_OLDTIMESTAMP`
- Archive old reports: `tar -czf old-reports.tar.gz allure-report/run_2025*`
- Consider automatic archival policy
